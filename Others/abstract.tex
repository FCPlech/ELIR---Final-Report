The maintenance of high voltage lines is a high-cost and dangerous activity for the employee's physical integrity. To replace human performance in risky activities, many robotic solutions are being implemented because of the reliability involved. The  Electrical Line Inspection Robot (ELIR) is a high voltage line inspection robot using thermal imaging, its sensing system has several sensors and is capable of displaying all occurrences detected during the mission and informing the date, time and location of each one. This final course work counts on the participation of doctoral students and masters with the objective of promoting research and development in robotics. The methodology, concepts and results acquired during the development of the perception system are described during this work
